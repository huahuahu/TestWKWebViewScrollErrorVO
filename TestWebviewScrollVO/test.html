        While your app is running in Xcode, the memory report available from Xcode’s Debug navigator shows the app’s current memory use, along with the highest value seen. The yellow region of the memory gauge indicates memory use high enough to trigger a warning. The app risks termination by iOS if its memory use enters the red region.
